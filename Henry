    "Hello Mr. uuuh..."

    The grizzled spectre's head whips up from his slump and he fixes uncomfortably unblinking eyes on you.

    "Henry Hadley! Served in the Second Legionary Corps under Colonel Sheldon!"
    
    He braces himself into a full salute before slowly beginning to tip to his right side and then abrubtly catching himself. You note his pants are tattered and he appears to be missing his right leg from the knee down.
    "Well since you're here, why don't you sit near? Let this crippled ol' soldier tell you a tale that's never been older, of a charge ill-fated that left my limb mutilated."

        *"Sure..."

        *"Oh, Christ. Please stop rhyming."
            "I never get to have my fun anymore, all you ingrates with your walking and... eh fine, ask your questions."

    ===henry_tale

        Henry goes on for what feels like an eternity of the tale of how he lost his limb, rhyming incessantly the entire way.

        The apparition sighs and leans himself comfortably, or at least as comfortable as he can get, against the wall.
  
     *  "Out of all of your fellow... ghosts, who do you think might be taking the socks?"
         He glares down at his right leg "This ol' thing still gets a fierce chill in it every night, i'd sure love to have something to keep warm, but it seems a lost cause...

     **  "Would anyone besides you want to take only right socks?"
        "I don't really do much pryin' into other spectres affairs, I only hear what I hear"

     *  "Does anyone here like to whistle?"
        "Well, on top of my propensity for rhyme, I'm also quite the songbird myself. Quite good at it too, best in the corps! I suppose that Alexander is jolly enough for it as well. And Martha whistles that song to her babe."

     ** "Would you characterize any of that whistling as spooky?"
        "I only use my tones for easing the soul, nothing to be called spooky is worth a parting here!"

	 *  "You ever notice anyone around here coughing?"
		"That Martha hacks and chokes worse than any of the old boys in the cavalry as I can remember em'."

        *** Henry adopts a thousand-yard stare and almost seems to forget you're standing there, you should move on...
