        "waahhh waahhh" "Oh will you shush little one."
        
        "Mrs.?"
        
        "Goldbloom, but you can just call me Martha Mr. Goldbloom well, he's not here." The baby continues to cry as Martha whistles a tune that seems to calm it down. 
        
        "Martha, I have some questions for you if you don't mind"
    
        * Anything you can tell me about the other ghosts in this house?
           "Oh my I could talk for days, no one likes to talk too much to me these days, but I figure it's because the baby is always crying. So I just clean up after these filthy men, gosh I wish I was born today not stuck cleaning up after men who don't care, doting on this little one. Heck if I find one more thing on the ground just laying around I well I just might go crazy. Smokey well he just loves to smoke, I don't think he's ever been clean a day in his life, I have half the mind to go make him bathe like I do with this little guy here. Maximilian, I just don't know always talking strangely big words and all, I'm smart don't get me wrong but sometimes I just can't get what he says at all. All I know is these boys are messy, and well it really makes me mad. By the way you got a light? I could really use one I know they say smoking is bad but with all the stress these days and well I figure im dead anyways so live it up." (The detective reaches out his lighter and lights her smoke, the baby clearly bothered by the smoke lets out another wail). {move_to_state(WantsSocks, A1)}
            "You really do have a lot to say. Martha i'll get back to you in a bit thank you for your time" 
            ** Good Bye.
                "Oh please do, I just love someone as clean kept as yourself, and well you really are a sight for sore eyes. I'm just so tired of cleaning up after these boys."
