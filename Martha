        UNKNON GHOST: "waahhh waahhh" "Oh will you shush little one."
        
        DETECTIVE: "Mrs.?"
        
        MARTHA: "Goldbloom, but you can just call me Martha Mr. Goldbloom well, he's not here." The baby continues to cry as Martha whistles a tune that seems to calm it down. 
        
        DETECTIVE: "Martha, I have some questions for you if you don't mind"
    
        * Anything you can tell me about the other ghosts in this house?
            MARTHA: "Oh my I could talk for day's, no one likes to talk too much to me these days, but I figure it's because the baby is always crying. So I just clean up after these filthy men, gosh I wish I was born today not stuck cleaning up after men who don't care, doting on this little one. Heck if I find one more thing on the ground just laying around I well I just might go crazy. Smokey well he just loves to smoke, I don't think he's ever been clean a day in his life, I have half the mind to go make him bathe like I do with this little guy here. Maximilian, I just don't know always talking strangely big words and all, I'm smart don't get me wrong but sometimes I just can't get what he says at all. All I know is these boys are messy, and well it really makes me mad. By the way you got a light? I could really use one I know they say smoking is bad but with all the stress these days and well I figure im dead anyways so live it up." (The detective reaches out his lighter and lights her smoke, the baby clearly bothered by the smoke lets out another wail).
            DETECTIVE: (Clearly a bit overwhelmed) "You really do have a lot to say. Martha i'll get back to you in a bit thank you for your time" 
            ** Good Bye.
                MARTHA: "Oh please do, I just love someone as clean kept as yourself, and well you really are a sight for sore eyes. I'm just so tired of cleaning up after these boys."
