        *"Hello sir, would you happen to know anything about the missing socks?"
        He cups his hand over his ear. "You want socks? I've got a few in my roo--"
        "No, I-" 
        **[Raise your voice.]The Detective starts yelling.
        "DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MISSING SOCKS?"
        "Woah there fella, you don't need to shout!" The ghost raised his voice and immediately began coughing violently.
        The Detective sighs.
            ***"Do you know anyone who would want right socks?"[], The Detective asked, loudly.
            The ghost stopped coughing. "Socks? Well, poor Martha is always cleaning up everywhere. She might have grabbed some, though I didn't notice it.
                    **** [Thank you.] "Thank you for your time." As The Detective walked away, the sooty ghost floated away to the next floor, covering them with ash as he flew overhead.
