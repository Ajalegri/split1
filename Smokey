        *"Hello sir, would you happen to know anything about the missing socks?"
        He cups his hand over his ear. "You want socks? I've got a few in my room if you want them."
        **[Raise your voice.]The Detective starts yelling.
        "DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MISSING SOCKS?"
        "Woah there fella, you don't need to shout!" The ghost raised his voice and immediately began coughing violently.
        ***"Are you alright?"
        The ghost recovers from his hacking fit, and waves away The Detective's concern. "I'm, *cough* fine. I picked up this cough before I died and it seems like I'm stuck with it."
        "I see. And you are...?"
        "They call me Smokey. Used to work the railroad near here but this cough, well, y'know."
        ****"Nice to meet you, Smokey.

                "Hmm, well I've got enough socks in my room, but old Henry never had socks in his time, maybe he'd want some. Come to think of it, poor Martha likes cleaning, she might have picked some up. Think it takes her mind off things. Either that or just gives her a chance to stew on some gossip. But I don't think any of us here would wanna steal nothing."

                "That's a queer question, if you don't mind me sayin'. 
                He thinks for a few seconds, putting his hand on his chin, leaving more soot on both his hand and face, somehow.
                "If I had to say, definitely Martha. Henry might want socks, but he wouldn't take anything without asking. Martha, though, might have picked some up when cleaning. When she's tidying up, she don't pay much attention to anything but that.

                "Oh sure! da--" He begins coughing again, and settles down after a couple seconds.
                "'Scuse me. Dang near all of us cough sometimes." He pauses for a moment. "'Cept Xiao over there, now I think of it. Man don't speak much, and certainly don't make noises when he don't mean to."

                "Odd question there, friend. Though I'd have to say probably Alexander. Man's, uh, eloquent. Too focused on talking to have time to cough.

            "No problem, I got loads of time these days." Smokey floats away, trailing a cloud of soot behind him.
