        UNKOWN: Hello there, young lad! How may I be of service to you today?
        
        DETECTIVE: Hi Mr...
        
        MAXIMILIAN: Sir Maximilian's the name, don't wear it out now, heh.
        
        DETECTIVE: Hello, Sir Maximilian. I have a couple questions for you...

            DETECTIVE: Do you know anyone here who likes to collect items?
            
            MAXIMILIAN: Yeah, I know lots of them love to collect stuff. In fact I believe everyone has collected something in their lives. Except Alexander, he seems like an oddball, never seeing the value or purpose of storing items. He deems it useless.
            
            DETECTIVE: I see... And how about yourself Sir Maximilian?
            
            MAXIMILIAN: I myself am sort of a connoisseur of item collection as well. You see I love to go adventuring around the world, visiting exotic places, like the GalÃ¡pagos Islands. I would always bring something back as a momento from my trip!
            
            DETECTIVE: Interesting. I'll keep that in mind.

            MAXIMILIAN: Hmm, now that you mention it. I've seen Martha and Henry both seem to have an interests to socks. Martha's a clean freak though, always wanting to wash our clothing, which I think is pretty weird since we're dead.
            
            DETECTIVE: That's some useful information. Thank you Maxie!

                    MAXIMILIAN: Okay, okay... Jeez, if you must insists, Alexander is a masterful whistler, also whistling to his favorite tune. Martha on the other hand, she is constantly whistling to her baby. That and her constant talking, it drives me crazy!
                    
                    DETECTIVE: How about yourself? Consider yourself a pretty good whistler?
                    
                    MAXIMILIAN: Yeah, I can whistle pretty good. Learned it from my old man who taught me how to do it with my fingers.
