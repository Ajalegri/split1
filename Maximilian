        UNKNON GHOST: "Hello there, young lad! How may I be of service to you today?", said the ghost.
        
        DETECTIVE: "Hi Mr..."
        
        MAXIMILIAN: Sir Maximilian's the name, don't wear it out now, heh.
        
        DETECTIVE: Hello, Sir Maximilian. I have a couple questions for you...
    
        * Anything you can tell me about the other ghosts in this house?
            MAXIMILIAN: Well I know that there are some really nasty ghosts in here. Some always coughing, even some that likes to steal things.
            DETECTIVE: Wow, thanks for the information.
            ** Good Bye.
                MAXIMILIAN: Goodbye!
