=== intro ===
This village is normally quiet, but right now the town square is abuzz. Everyone's right sock has been stolen!

Who would want everyone's right sock? All the villagers know is that when the socks were stolen, they all heard someone coughing and whistling an eerie tune.

They're also certain that one of the ghosts living in an abandoned hotel nearby are to blame, and so The Detective investigates.
