= interrogation
    The detective approached a ghost who's face was covered.

    They waved their hands at them and got their attention. The ghost looked at him with attentive, but fearful eyes. 

    "Hello" the detective says and wave their hands again. 

    * "Have you heard about socks going missing?"

        The ghost tilted their head and looked at the detective, puzzled. Nothing but silence followed. 

        This particular ghost didn't look like the others. They wore a worn-out gown and pair of trousers, along with a bandana-esque scarf around their neck. If there was a guess, the ghost looked elderly, but the detective couldn't make out their face.

        "May I ask what your name is?" the detective asked, but was met with more confusion and silence.

        "You're not gonna get too much out of her." another voice spoke.

            *"Who's there?" 
            
            Another ghost appeared beside the previous one. 

            "Hello. I'm Xiao, it's nice to meet you." 

            Xiao looked completely different than the previous ghost, the detective could make out that they were mid-age and clearly of asian descent. He was wearing glasses along with a business-formal outfit.
            
            Xiao was empty-handed and when he introduced himself, he gave a slight bow in your direction. 

            "Hello Xiao, if it is okay, I would like to ask a few questions to..." the detective gestured toward the other ghost. 

            "Oh you can call her Chó͘-má and you're more than welcome to ask Chó͘-má some questions, but I'm just wondering how your Hokkien is?" Xiao asked. The detective looked at Chó͘-má then looked back to Xiao.

            "Alright then. Xiao, may I ask you a few questions?" He nodded.

                *"Who are you?" 
                "My name is Xiao, I am a fourth generation immigrant. This is Chó͘-má, my great-grandmother." Xiao gestures towards Chó͘-má who was staring at Xiao with the greatest smile on her face. 
                    *"Chó͘-má seems to be looking at you."
                    "Ah pay it no mind. She does this regularly, even my Ama does this too. It bothers me sometimes, but I know they mean no harm." Xiao looked back at Chó͘-má and smiled somberly.

                    Xiao starts whistling a melodic tone. The detective patiently listened and waited for Xiao to finish.

                *"What do you know about the missing Socks?"
                "Chó͘-má was telling me about something going on with the other ghosts. "
