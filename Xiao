= interrogation
    I approached a ghost who's name was unknown.

    I waved my hands at them and got their attention. They looked at me with attentive, but fearful eyes. 

    "Hello" I say and wave my hands again. 

    * "Have you heard about socks going missing?"



        They tilted their head and looked at me puzzled. 
        /*
         Speak about their clothing
            - Need to do more research on this. 
         
         Realize that they do no speak English
         
         Another ghost appears, younger generation, and is able to speak for/translate your conversation.
            - Younger ghost is first generation immigrant.
